# Read.Me file for the Module 2 VBA project - Stock Analysis.

# The purpose of this porject was to take raw stock data and create a summary page showing quarterly data for the ticker symbol and the respective open and close price change, percentage change of the open and close, as well as the total quarterly volume.

# An additional summary table also was created to show the ticker with the respective greatest percentage increase, decrease and total volume.

# The VBA script creates a macro that will allow you to review a quarters worth of stock data with a click of a button. This simplifies analysis of the stock tickers to get baseline data for review. 

# To get to the final program, there was a series of for loops and if statements that lended to pulling and compiling the data in the correct manner.

# I had challenges with grammer and syntax errors. I learned to slow down and not over delcare variables. To keep it simple and take it step by step to make sure the code is working a long the way. My biggest challenge was to utilize the resources around me to get the code to work properly. With new content it can be frustrating when things are not working, when they feel they should be. 

# I look forward to building off of VBA and learning more about programming languarge and how to utilize them for real world material.
